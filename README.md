# jfsOtterVIS
## General Info
The software is an extention of the [pyCCDGUI.py](https://tcd1304.wordpress.com/downloads/) from Esben Rossel and is based on his spectrophotometer ([OtterVIS LGL](https://hackaday.io/project/10738-ottervis-lgl-spectrophotometer)) which uses the TCD1304 chip. 
In order to use the software you should have already build Rosssel's spectrophometer. For more information, visit [Leaves of Science](https://science.jefro.de/).
## Features of the software
* the calibration of the instrument in nm
* the use of the spectrophometer as a photometer
* the survey of simple kinetics

##  Branches
* CalibrationByArray: Now its possible to calibrate the instrument by an csv-file for example non_linear_calibarray_HgCd.csv
## Installation
Recomendation: it is best to run the python program under the anaconda framework.
* Install anaconda [optional]
* run under the anaconda-shell: conda install -c anaconda pyserial
* download the software from github jfsCDDGUI.zip and unpack to /your_choice/
* go to /your_choice/ and run under anaconda-shell: python jfCCDGUI.py
